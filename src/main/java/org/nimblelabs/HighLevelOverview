1. `Main` class: This is the entry point of your application. It creates a `TravelPackageService`, generates a list of `Destination` objects, and creates a `TravelAgency`. It then enters a loop where it interacts with the user, asking if they are interested in any of the destinations.

2. `TravelPackageService` class: This class is responsible for creating `Destination` objects and `TravelPackage` objects. It also handles user interaction, such as getting passenger details, chosen destination, and chosen activity.

7. `Passenger` class: This class represents a passenger. It has methods to sign up for an activity.
